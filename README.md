When
====

My goals with this fork are:

* Port the functionality to Python (for various reasons, one of which being my preferred language)
* To add some more standards, like the datetime "2018-07-21 05:00:00" and "2018-07-21T05:00:00"
* Add two types of labelling/tagging: single word, like with # (without breaking current single line comments) and key value pairs.
* Direct iCal file export **or** read and write directly from an ical file or url (bringing when into the modern age to allow for viewing shared calendars.

When is an extremely simple personal calendar program, aimed at the Unix geek who wants something minimalistic. It can keep track of things you need to do on particular dates. There are a lot of calendar and "personal information manager" programs out there, so what reasons are there to use When?

* It's a very short and simple program, so you can easily tinker with it yourself.
* It doesn't depend on any libraries, so it's easy to install. You should be able to install it on any system where Perl is available, even if you don't have privileges for installing libraries.
* Its file format is a simple text file, which you can edit in your favorite editor.

There is an ubuntu package, which is called when.
